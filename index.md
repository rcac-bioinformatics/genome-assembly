## Welcome to the Genome Assembly Workshop

This workshop provides a hands-on introduction to **long-read genome assembly** using **HiFiasm and Flye**, optimized for the **RCAC cluster**. You'll learn best practices for **assembly, polishing, and scaffolding with Bionano optical maps**, along with strategies for **quality assessment and troubleshooting**.  

Designed for researchers and bioinformaticians, this workshop will equip you with the skills to build **high-quality, reproducible genome assemblies** on **RCAC HPC resources**.  

Letâ€™s get started!
